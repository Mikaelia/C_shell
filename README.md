# Simple Shell Project

## Synopsis
This is a simple shell recreation of a UNIX command line interpreter.

## Description
This simple shell can read, interpret, and execute commands. Once the commands are executed it will free up any memory and terminate.

## Environment
This shell was built and tested in an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using vagrant in VirtualBox.

## How to Install
Clone this repository and compile the files into an executable using the GCC compiler.
```
https://github.com/
```
All files need to be compiled on an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS machine using:
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh

## Usage
After compilation you can start the program by running the command:
```./hsh```

You can also use most shell commands like: ```ls -la```, ```pwd```,  ```cat``` etc.

## Built-Ins
